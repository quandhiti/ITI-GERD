### Description
The dataset ITI-GERD involves 688 Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy images which mostly related to Gastroesophageal Reflux disease (GERD). Abnormality areas (any lesion due to the impact of GERD) in the images are localized and stored in "Masks" folder while the original images are stored in "Images" folder.
